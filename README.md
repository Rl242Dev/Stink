Since Stink has a lot of functions, here's a summary of all you need to know, starting with NoRecoil.

NoRecoil:

------------------------------

1. Open NoRecoil.ahk in a program like Notepad++. Windows' Notepad is good, but Notepad++ is better suited for this job.

2. Edit the number next to "Sleep" according to your sensitivity. Higher sensitivities require larger numbers. Lower sensitivities require lower numbers.

3. You're ready to play the game. If you get banned, don't complain, you're using a hack anyways and you're fully aware of that.


---------------------------

Now that NoRecoil is done, it's time to set ShortCuts up. The file should be explanation enough, but here's a tutorial in case you're confused or don't 
know what to do.

--------------------------

ShortCuts:

1. Open ShortCuts.py in a program like Notepad++. Windows Notepad works, but Notepad++ is more reliable, as mentioned before.

2. Edit 'YouChoose' to set the name of your ShortCut eg('COD').

3.Type the directory the .exe is in (eg: C:\\Program Files\\Call Of Duty Modern Warfare\\codmw.exe). Allways put 2 Backwards Slash [Ctrl + Alt + 8]
